abstract="Statistics from dynamic analysis of programs are used to compare the efficiency of different methods to access global variables. The method where static links are used for access is shown to be at least as efficient as the display method. The use of the linked list method also leads to a simpler runtime system and allows separately compiled modules to execute at any level in the resulting program. The results of the dynamic analysis are presented in a form which allows comparison of the access methods in language implementations on specific computers. Experience with using two different access methods in an implementation of Simula67 concludes the paper.",
