TDDB44 Lab Instruction
======================

To compile the documentation you will need many LaTeX and Python packages.
They can be found under [docker/Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile).

The whole documentation can also be built by [Gitlab CI/CD](../.gitlab-ci.yml),
which performs tasks such as checking out the x86 reference into the
correct location.
